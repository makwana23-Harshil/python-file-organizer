How to Run

1. First, clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/makwana23-Harshil/python-file-organizer.git

2. Head into the project folder:
cd python-file-organizer

3. Start the script:
python file_organizer.py

4. When the script asks, just type in the full path to the folder you want to organize.
C:\Users\profiles\Downloads

Or, if you’re on Linux or macOS:
/home/Downloads/10-02-24

Requirements

All you need is Python 3.x. No need to install any extra libraries.

Note

The script organizes files only—it skips folders. If there’s already a file with the same name, the script overwrites it. So, keep that in mind.
